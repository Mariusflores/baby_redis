/**
 * A simple in-memory store for handling string and set operations.
 * The InMemoryStore class provides methods for setting and getting string key-value pairs, adding and removing members from sets, checking set membership, and retrieving all members of a set.

 * The class also includes a method for purging keys from both the string and set stores, as well as methods for writing and reading snapshots of the current state of the in-memory store using the SnapshotManager.
